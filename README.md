# Banking Application

## Project Description

The Banking Application focuses on user interaction and the basic functionalities present within an online banking platform. Within the application, user interaction involves using the Customer Service Bot and making different requests like Credit, Loan, and Job applications. These requests submitted must then be reviewed and approved by a designated banking manager. Also, there is a login system that ensures each user has individual and secure access to their information, as well as a place where questions can be asked and answered. For general banking functions, each user can open and close different types of financial accounts, as well as withdraw, deposit, or transfer funds. Users can also view their account and user information through their main profile and access multiple pages about the bank across the application.
