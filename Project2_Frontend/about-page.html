        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>The Banking Application focuses on user interaction and the basic functionalities present
            within an online banking platform. Within the application, user interaction involves using the
            Customer Service Bot and making different requests like Credit, Loan, and Job applications.
            These requests submitted must then be reviewed and approved by a designated banking manager.
            Also, there is a login system that ensures each user has individual and secure access to their
            information, as well as a place where questions can be asked and answered. For general banking
            functions, each user can open and close different types of financial accounts, as well as withdraw,
            deposit, or transfer funds. Users can also view their account and user information through their
            main profile and access multiple pages about the bank across the application.</p>
